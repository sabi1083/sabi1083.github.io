            <h1>Interview with Avid Senior Principal Software Engineer Joe Plazak</h1>
            <p>
                On the shortlist of software tailored for musicians, a general music notation editor is usually at the top. 
                Joseph Plazak and his team at Avid currently manage one of the most popular and powerful notation editors out there: Sibelius.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sibelius is a program with the goal of streamlining the music writing process for composers. 
                The software allows users to create compositions of one or many instruments, and allows quick edits to sections, 
                instant playback, and intuitive exporting  to print scores and sheet music.

                Joe is currently a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Avid, a prominent music technology company that creates software for 
                musicians, namely Pro Tools and Sibelius. He’s been on the Avid team for over four years, working primarily with music notation 
                as the Sibelius Product Owner. Joe also spent many years in academia, as a music research professor at both McGill University and 
                Illinois Wesleyan University, and a music perception researcher at Concordia University.

            <p>
                As an Illinois native, Joe comments on the joy of working in his current home, Montreal, specifically its bilingual and multicultural nature.

                My goal for this interview was to familiarize myself with Joe and get to know more about his career at Avid. I asked him
                about his experience leading up to his current occupation to get a feel for the qualities and experiences necessary for a student
                to follow in his footsteps.

                Interview with Joe Plazak:
            </h3>
            <h4>
                What is your job title, and what would you define as your main responsibilities at Avid?
            </h4>
            <p>
                It’s actually really funny because in most interviews when I’m asked to describe my Job Title I somehow always botch it. 
                It's much simpler to skip the title and go straight to what I do. I work with the Sibelius team, and I play multiple roles. 
                Most prominent is that I’m the Product Owner, which means I represent the voice of the customer to the development team. 
                I serve as a developer and as a designer, so while we try to find out if specific functions and features will work or not I also 
                spend time fleshing out what the UI looks like. At the same time, having been a developer first, I’m also thinking about what’s possible
                 and the easiest, fastest way to move forward. I’m present at all nodes on the tightly wound “spiral” for my team: I represent the 
                 voice of the customer and their needs, we then think of a way to implement this need and how to develop it, and ultimately we 
                 create and implement the function to the customer to fill their need. I'm just one part of a really awesome software team.

            </p>
            <h4>
                How big is your team?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Between the multiple product owners, the scrum master, QAs, and others our scrum group is about 15 people on average. If you account for
                marketing and the business side there is a much larger number supporting the program, but our development team is a nice small size.
            </p>
            <h4>
                What do you enjoy most about woring at Avid?
            </h4>
            <p>
                There’s a lot of tech jobs, so the cool thing about tech jobs is the ability to land one in a domain that 
                aligns with you and your interests. For me, when I switched over into tech, Avid was a natural perfect fit because of my background 
                in music. I've played and researched music my whole life. Avid has some super cool offerings for audio and music, and is a 
                nice sized tech company compared to a giant like Google or Microsoft, but at the same time not a startup. Half of your success in life 
                is making sure you end up in the right place as opposed to what you know or what you can do. 

            </p>
            <h4>
                You said you had not only a background in music, but also in development, could you elaborate on that?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I started as a drummer and was always into punk music and rock music, but in high school I had the opportunity to learn about jazz 
                and gained experience with jazz percussion. Later I realized I wanted to compose so I learned to play guitar, and dove into the world of 
                multi-track recording and doing my own things, recording drums, bass, guitar, singing, songwriting, etc. In my undergraduate program I 
                wanted to continue being a composer, performing and composing  more jazz and guitar, but near the end of my studies I found a book about 
                music psychology that totally changed my life and outlook for the future. From there I went to Ohio State University for grad school, 
                with the goal of completing a masters and Phd in music theory and studying music cognition. When I was done, I was 27 years old, and found a 
                really cool job working as a music theory professor, which was nuts because I was basically a kid at the time. I did that for a number 
                of years, before moving here to Montreal where my wife was living at the time. At that point I decided to take a break to look for a job 
                in Montreal, where I retrained in tech. I completed a one year program at the university here in Montreal and found a job at Avid, and 
                decided it was time to hand in my old professor tweed jackets for a developer title. I’ve been here at Avid for about four and a half years.

            <h4>
                Do you have any tips for a fellow drummer in a music technology undergraduate program looking to follow in your footsteps?
            </h4>
            <p>
                It’s a small scene. Think about all the software that you use and their competitors (there’s only a handful of companies in that space), 
                and research where those companies are based and decide whether you might want to live there, then start reaching out and making contacts
                 to these people. It’s a struggle right now to find developers who are also musicians. In our case on the Sibelius team we are always looking 
                 for people with a background in music and development. To anybody looking to get into that scene, you first have to know that those jobs do 
                 indeed exist, but also where it is that you might want to live or who you want to create the next generation of music products with and 
                 then reach out to them.
