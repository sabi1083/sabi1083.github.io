            <h1>Interview with Avid Senior Principal Software Engineer Joe Plazak</h1>
            <h5>Interviewed on November 12th, 2021</h5>
            <h5>Questions, interview, and report by Ben Mayton</h5>
            <p>
                On the shortlist of software tailored for musicians, a general music notation editor is usually at the top. 
                Joseph Plazak and his team at Avid currently manage one of the most popular and powerful notation editors out there: Sibelius.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sibelius is a program with the goal of streamlining the music writing process for composers. 
                The software allows users to create compositions of one or many instruments, and allows quick edits to sections, 
                instant playback, and intuitive exporting  to print scores and sheet music.

            </p>
            <p>
                Joe is currently a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Avid, a prominent music technology company that creates software for 
                musicians, namely Pro Tools and Sibelius. He’s been on the Avid team for over four years, working primarily with music notation 
                as the Sibelius Product Owner. Joe also spent many years in academia, as a music research professor at both McGill University and 
                Illinois Wesleyan University, and a music perception researcher at Concordia University.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an Illinois native, Joe comments on the joy of working in his current home, Montreal, specifically its bilingual and multicultural nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal for this interview was to familiarize myself with Joe and get to know more about his career at Avid. I asked him
                about his experience leading up to his current occupation to get a feel for the qualities and experiences necessary for a student
                to follow in his footsteps.

            <h3>
                Interview with Joe Plazak:
            </h3>
            <h4>
                What is your job title, and what would you define as your main responsibilities at Avid?
            </h4>
            <p>
                It’s actually really funny because in most interviews when I’m asked to describe my Job Title I somehow always botch it. 
                It's much simpler to skip the title and go straight to what I do. I work with the Sibelius team, and I play multiple roles. 
                Most prominent is that I’m the Product Owner, which means I represent the voice of the customer to the development team. 
                I serve as a developer and as a designer, so while we try to find out if specific functions and features will work or not I also 
                spend time fleshing out what the UI looks like. At the same time, having been a developer first, I’m also thinking about what’s possible
                 and the easiest, fastest way to move forward. I’m present at all nodes on the tightly wound “spiral” for my team: I represent the 
                 voice of the customer and their needs, we then think of a way to implement this need and how to develop it, and ultimately we 
                 create and implement the function to the customer to fill their need. I'm just one part of a really awesome software team.

            </p>
            <h4>
                How big is your team?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Between the multiple product owners, the scrum master, QAs, and others our scrum group is about 15 people on average. If you account for
                marketing and the business side there is a much larger number supporting the program, but our development team is a nice small size.
            </p>
            <h4>
                What do you enjoy most about woring at Avid?
            </h4>
            <p>
                There’s a lot of tech jobs, so the cool thing about tech jobs is the ability to land one in a domain that 
                aligns with you and your interests. For me, when I switched over into tech, Avid was a natural perfect fit because of my background 
                in music. I've played and researched music my whole life. Avid has some super cool offerings for audio and music, and is a 
                nice sized tech company compared to a giant like Google or Microsoft, but at the same time not a startup. Half of your success in life 
                is making sure you end up in the right place as opposed to what you know or what you can do. 

            </p>
            <h4>
                You said you had not only a background in music, but also in development, could you elaborate on that?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I started as a drummer and was always into punk music and rock music, but in high school I had the opportunity to learn about jazz 
                and gained experience with jazz percussion. Later I realized I wanted to compose so I learned to play guitar, and dove into the world of 
                multi-track recording and doing my own things, recording drums, bass, guitar, singing, songwriting, etc. In my undergraduate program I 
                wanted to continue being a composer, performing and composing  more jazz and guitar, but near the end of my studies I found a book about 
                music psychology that totally changed my life and outlook for the future. From there I went to Ohio State University for grad school, 
                with the goal of completing a masters and Phd in music theory and studying music cognition. When I was done, I was 27 years old, and found a 
                really cool job working as a music theory professor, which was nuts because I was basically a kid at the time. I did that for a number 
                of years, before moving here to Montreal where my wife was living at the time. At that point I decided to take a break to look for a job 
                in Montreal, where I retrained in tech. I completed a one year program at the university here in Montreal and found a job at Avid, and 
                decided it was time to hand in my old professor tweed jackets for a developer title. I’ve been here at Avid for about four and a half years.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Do you have any tips for a fellow drummer in a music technology undergraduate program looking to follow in your footsteps?
            </h4>
            <p>
                It’s a small scene. Think about all the software that you use and their competitors (there’s only a handful of companies in that space), 
                and research where those companies are based and decide whether you might want to live there, then start reaching out and making contacts
                 to these people. It’s a struggle right now to find developers who are also musicians. In our case on the Sibelius team we are always looking 
                 for people with a background in music and development. To anybody looking to get into that scene, you first have to know that those jobs do 
                 indeed exist, but also where it is that you might want to live or who you want to create the next generation of music products with and 
                 then reach out to them. 

            </p>
            <h4>
                Going back to the Sibelius team and your day to day operations, could you describe some challenges you face?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Sibelius is a legacy product, it's been around for about thirty years. The copyrights in some of our code go back to 1987. 
                Working with software that’s been around for so long presents its own unique challenges. We have users that use versions of Sibelius that 
                are 15 years old, and they rely on those older versions for their specific needs. It’s often difficult not breaking those features that are 
                near and dear to those users, while simultaneously creating the features that are needed for the users of tomorrow. As an example, Sibelius 
                just recently launched for the iPad and iPhone versions, and importing the older desktop versions to a mobile UI challenges us to rethink 
                how users utilize music notation. It’s interesting balancing the needs of those legacy users with the needs of users of today and tomorrow 
                that will start fresh with our software. One of the keys to that balance is that people want to make music wherever they’re at, and I believe 
                if they have their phone or device with them they should be able to achieve that. I'll add that we've been devoloping for thirty years but its
                still not perfect. It's an amazingly complex problem space when working in music notation and maybe someday, it might be completely solved!

            </p>
            <h4>
                What would you say are the skills or tools from your music or development background that you use most now?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Honestly, its the skills I haven't even talked about yet. The skills I find that help me the most are the skills I learned in my training for my
                Phd in music theory. Those are mainly problem solving skills, the abilty to take apart a large complex problem and break it down into 50 or so steps, and
                then tackle them one at a time and know when to move from one step to the next. The most important process might be the ability to know when you're not
                moving in the right direction and then change directions towards something better efficiently. Sometimes you will be working diligently and putting lots of
                care into something until you find that you need to completely stop that work because it isn't serving the greater purpose anymore. In tech we often will define
                the kind of work we'll be doing for the next two weeks, and then find out on day three its time to completely switch gears and move towards something else. These
                are the skills I use the most, the problem solving, organizing, and ability to tackle small problems that solve the big problems.
            </p>
            <h4>
                How does your team normally respond in the event that the work for the week needs to be scrapped and that the team needs to change directions?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I'm very fortunate to be graced with my team's flexibility. The whole idea of scrum thrives on the idea of responsibility to the users, but also being open
                and honest with eachother. Whether it's me or often another developer who lets the team know that we need to change what we are doing, it's never a huge issue
                because of the amazing team I get to work with.
            </p>
            <h4>
                As a parting question, what would you say keeps you motivated and driving towards creating a better and more expansive version of Sibelius?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I recently reflected on two experiences that helped me hold on to the idea that the work I am doing is the work I should be doing. The first happened at a collaboration
                we had with the Berklee College of Music, specifically with their assistive technologies lab. Our goal was to make it so that Sibelius is fully functional for
                visually impaired users, and have every function available through keboard shortcuts. Everything that happens on the score gets read back to the user as well. 
                It's an ongoing effort and we have lots of work to do, but someone in the program said to me "You aren't just making a software that's accessible to me, you're aiding me
                in my effort to complete a music education degree at a university." That's pretty amazing because it's not just music at that point, you're literally unlocking the power of formal education
                for someone.
            </p>
            <p>
                As another example, we just released the iPad and iPhone application this year, and in order to do that we had to create unique touch gestures for inputting
                notes into the score. The day after the application launched I watched a video of a YouTuber in France putting notes in the score using the swipe gestures.
                I just sat back for a second and realized I invented that at my kitchen table, and that something that literally came out of my kitchen is being utilized and
                enjoyed around the world. I had a rather well known film composer call me, and they said they woke up and had a theme in their head for a score, and that they
                got out their phone and put it into Siblius. Then, when you're watching these movies, you're thinking wow, I can't believe it, my own software helped to create
                this piece of art and is being used right now to make music. It's pretty motivating seeing what people do with the tools that you built.

                Just talking with Joe was an experience in itself, he not only has an impressive resume and knows exactly what he's talking about when it comes to
                Siblius or problem solving or music notation, but also a wise, invested, and caring demeanor that exemplifies the love he has for what he does
                every day at Avid. I hope to talk again with him soon about Sibelius or the music scene in general, and learned quite a bit about developing for a 
                music technology company. Hopefully this information will aid me in my pursuits in our ever-expanding music tech field.
